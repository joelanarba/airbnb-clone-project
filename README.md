### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system because it:

- **Reduces friction:** Users can easily search, view, and book properties without confusion or delays.
- **Boosts conversions:** A smooth and intuitive interface encourages users to complete their bookings.
- **Builds trust:** Clear layouts and transparent processes help users feel secure when making payments.
- **Enhances accessibility:** Inclusive design ensures everyone, including people with disabilities, can use the platform effectively.
- **Increases satisfaction:** A well-designed app makes users more likely to return and recommend the service.

By focusing on these aspects, the Airbnb Clone aims to deliver a professional, reliable, and enjoyable experience for all users.
